## The DH Tool Registry

Digital Humanities tool directories like DiRT, Bamboo, and TaPOR 3 have become essential, addressing the need for an overview of computational tools in research. These directories often face challenges like lack of permanent funding, reliance on unpaid curators, and use of proprietary infrastructures which limit accessibility and sustainability. They generally provide only limited APIs with poor documentation, focusing instead on human-readable interfaces.

In contrast, the Kompetenzwerkstatt Digital Humanities and NFDI4Memory at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin promote a different approach through minimal computing and Open Science, utilizing existing resources and open-source platforms like Wikidata. This approach aims to develop a basic, sustainable model for tool registries that are openly accessible, linked, and continuously updated. The proposed web application uses Wikidata to ensure data openness and adaptability to other domains.

The objective is to establish a minimal infrastructure for subject-specific tool registries that leverage Wikidata for maintaining and sharing research tools and methods. This includes developing data models, curating tool samples, and creating workflows for querying and displaying data. Such an infrastructure would enhance visibility, accessibility, and sustainability of digital humanities resources, aligning with ongoing efforts to integrate Wikidata into research and GLAM institutions as a content provider and data curator.
